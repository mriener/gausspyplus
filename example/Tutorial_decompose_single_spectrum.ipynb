    "In the following we manually set the parameters for the GaussPy+ preparation and Stage 1 of the decomposition. \n",
    "The values of these parameters correspond mostly to the GaussPy+ default values, which yielded good decomposition results for the fitting of CO spectra. See Table F.2 in [Riener et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10506) for a more detailed description of the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important parameters to change are `alpha1`, `alpha2`, `snr`, and `significance` (also referred to as essential parameters). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `alpha1` and `alpha2` parameters define the kernel size for the smoothing. Note how changing their values impacts the second derivative of the smoothed spectrum (shown in red in the upper and lower left panels in the diagnostic plot that is printed after running the cell below). We recommend setting `alpha1` to a lower value than `alpha2`. We only set `alpha1` and `alpha2` manually for this example of a decomposition of a single spectrum. Usually, we would automatically infer the values for `alpha1` and `alpha2` via a training set (see the notebook `Tutorial_example-GRS`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `snr` and `significance` parameters define the minimum S/N ratio and the minimum integrated area Gaussian fit components have to fulfill. If you find that ``GaussPy+`` fits too many noise peaks, try setting either the ``significance`` or ``snr`` parameters to higher values. In contrast, if you find that many low-intensity and/or narrow peaks are not fit at all, set one or both of these parameters to lower values. See Sect. 3.2.1.2 and 3.2.1.3 in [Riener et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10506) for a description about the ``significance`` and ``snr`` parameters; also see App. C.3 for how changing one or both of these parameters can impact the decomposition results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining parameters control more advanced settings of the algorithm and we recommend playing around with these values only after good settings for the four essential parameters have been found. However, if you run ``GaussPy+`` on HI datasets we recommend to set the ``decompose.refit_broad`` and ``decompose.refit_blended`` parameters to ``False`` (see Sect. 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.3 in [Riener et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10506))."

The original input spectrum is shown in black solid lines and the S/N threshold for the original spectrum (``snr`` parameter) is shown with the horizontal dashed black line. The red line indicates the second derivative of the spectrum that was obtained after smoothing the original spectrum with the $\\alpha_{1}$ (``alpha1``) parameter and the red dashed horizontal lines show the corresponding S/N threshold for the second derivative. Initial guesses for the Gaussian fit parameters are shown in green and are determined by peaks in the original spectrum and second derivative of the smoothed spectrum.\n",

This phase proceeds in a similar way to the first phase, with the difference that now the $\\alpha_{2}$ (``alpha2``) parameter is used to smooth the residual before the derivatives are computed. Note that this step is not performed if the ``two_phase_decomposition`` parameter is set to ``False``.\n",

If the ``improve_fitting`` parameter is set to ``True``, the decomposition results correspond to the outcome of the improved fitting routine of GaussPy+, which aims to further improve the final fitting results of GaussPy. Users can set the ``improve_fitting`` parameter to ``True`` or ``False`` to check the effect of the improved fitting routine of GaussPy+. Note that the fit results of GaussPy+ correspond to the stage before the spatially coherent refitting phases, so decomposition results can still change later on based on neighboring fit results."
